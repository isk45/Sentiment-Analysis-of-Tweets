# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets

This is my first project in python
In this project I analysis the Sentiment of bunch of tweets in a dataset using the 
number of replies, retweets and analyzing the number of positive and negative words 
used in the tweet and giving it a net positive and negative Score. A positive Score 
means a positive tweet and negative score means a negative sentiment of a tweet. 
It is done using file handling in Python 
I also ploted a Scatter plot of the Net Score vs NO of retweets using MS Excel
